# Health-Lifestyle-Analysis

✨ Health & Lifestyle Analytics Using Machine Learning
💫 Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing health, lifestyle, and behavioral data to gain meaningful insights and build predictive machine learning models. The system predicts BMI categories, stress levels, and identifies lifestyle patterns using both supervised and unsupervised learning techniques.

The project demonstrates complete data preprocessing, feature selection, model building, evaluation, and visualization using Python.

✨ Objectives

Analyze health and lifestyle data using exploratory data analysis (EDA).

Predict BMI using regression and classification techniques.

Predict Stress Levels using multiple classification models.

Compare machine learning models based on performance metrics.

Identify hidden lifestyle patterns using clustering algorithms.

Visualize results for better interpretability.
